1. To go more in depth on the outline of submission three I will add two more enemy types as well as a boss. 
I don't have a clear idea of what I'd like the final boss to be so making a single enemy that comes after a 
trigger should also make the outline/bulk of the work of a final boss. I already have one obstacle/enemy type 
so I will make 2 more unique ones. They will not be production style, clones or singleton, they will simply 
be called in place of obstacles for testing. I will make a scoreboard and include the points directly to the 
next round of enemies. This next submission is largely on track. I already know where the changes will come. 
Submission 4 will be largely the same as submission 3, sprites, music, sound effects, animations, etc. Mostly 
tested by themselves. the moving background and animation/wav file manipulation is not so unreachable that I 
need a whole submission dedicated to them. Rather, having submission 4 being all finalized components submission 
5 will be clean up. Sprites, user testing, coding implementation, etc. I can explain more in later write-ups.

2. I made the game work with point and graphics mostly scaled and tested. I did not do much work past getting 
the game running smoothly. I did not build a final boss. I never got around to drawing one. While following a 
tutorial to interact with shapes and learn movement was a good start. Now knowing how connections and slots work,
at least moreso than I did, saves a lot of vs making a rect and having it behave some similar way.

3. The next deadline will be putting it all together. Finish level 1 go to level 2, 3, etc. Boss fight. I have 
music and sound effects, they live on a computer I can't get to at the moment but I'd like to get more effects.
Levels will start and continue until death or end. Name will be prompted. Weapon drops/seamless change, 
scoreboard/health rework, boss fight, level iteration, and graphic buffs are things TODO.
