1)The board will be created as well as player sprites and obstacles. 
They should be able to move horizontally, die, and compile a score. 
There will be no crash animations, no sounds, nor moving background. 
A player should be able to play a bare bones version of the game. 
I will need to learn concurrent player input but once movement is 
learned object interactions are well within my scope. I have little 
experience with it but I will need to interact with a time management 
function as time will impact spawn rates of many objects during this 
patch and in later patches.

2) I completed movement and collisions of bullets as well as enemy movement based 
on a random seed. The player can play a never ending version of the game 
versus squares. I completed everything I planned to involving taking input from
a keyboard and obstacles have been created. They spawn, move, and are destroyed
as well as deleted upon impact with a bullet. I have almost completed the first gun, 
it's speed and rate of fire will be adjusted. I did not make a scoreboard but I 
commented clearly where it should go. I did less work then I planned while in NY
skiing as I had little time near my laptop and the few hours I fully dedicated
were spent making enemy movement and learning how to connect different objects
in QT. Collisions caused seg faults for a long time but I have since worked them
out.

3) To go more in depth on the outline of submission three I will add two more enemy types
as well as a boss. I don't have a clear idea of what I'd like the final boss to be 
so making a single enemy that comes after a trigger should also make the outline/bulk of
the work of a final boss. I already have one obstacle/enemy type so I will make 2 more unique 
ones. They will not be production style, clones or singleton, they will simply be called
in place of obstacles for testing. I will make a scoreboard and include the points directly to
the next round of enemies. This next submission is largely on track. I already know where the
changes will come. Submission 4 will be largely the same as submission 3, sprites, music, sound effects,
animations, etc. Mostly tested by themselves. the moving background and animation/wav file manipulation
is not so unreachable that I need a whole submission dedicated to them. Rather, having submission 4 
being all finalized components submission 5 will be clean up. Sprites, user testing, coding implementation,
etc. I can explain more in later write-ups.

4) PLEASE SEE FILE "HW3_SCREENSHOT.png" and note collision works but is hard to time with screen shots.
